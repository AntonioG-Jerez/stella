\section{Geometry input: the \texttt{wout*.nc} file}

\section{The physics case input: the \texttt{*.in} file}

\stella~uses for its execution a single input file. In this section, 
we describe how this is structured in different 
namelists and which input variables can be included in each of these. The input file, 
which should include the suffix \texttt{.in} at the end of its name, is structured
if the following namelists:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily \&zgrid\_parameters}
\item {\ttfamily \&geo\_knobs}
\item ...
\end{itemize}

In the following sections the description of the different input variables that 
each namelist has is provided. The purpose, description, variable type, etc
of each variable is displayed in tabular format, where the header shows the name of the 
variable in  teletypefont font family and the correponding symbol, if any, 
used in other parts of the documents.

\myvar{\ttt{nfield\_periods}}{}
{Definition of the flux tube characteristics.}
{Being $\Nfp$ the number of field periods per $2\pi$ toroidal 
segment of a given equilibrum (e.g. $\Nfp=5$ for W7-X), 
\ttt{nfield\_periods} is the 
number of toroidal field periods the flux tube extents along 
the $\zeta$ direction. Considering the safety factor $q$ at 
a given flux surface, set through the variable \ttt{torflux}, 
if the flux tube is wanted to extent along $N_{\theta}$ poloidal 
turns, i.e. covering the range $\left(-N_{\theta}\pi, N_{\theta}\pi\right)$ 
in $\theta$, the following rule can be written to set accordingly 
\ttt{nfield\_periods}number of divisions of the magnetic field line 
for the chosen flux tube along the coordinate $\zeta$.
\begin{equation}
  \ttt{nfield\_periods}=q\Nfp N_{\theta}
